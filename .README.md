The key characteristics that give it agent-like qualities are:

Autonomous Decision Making:
The system independently decides whether to use cached results or perform a new search based on the similarity of the query to previous searches. This demonstrates a level of autonomy in its operation.
Adaptive Behavior:
Through the similarity search function, the system adapts its response based on past experiences (previous searches). It can recognize similar queries and provide faster, potentially more relevant results by leveraging its "memory" of past searches.
Proactive Assistance:
In the enhanced GPT relevance analysis, the system goes beyond simply listing results. It proactively:

Identifies the most relevant result and explains why
Provides a direct answer when possible
Suggests next steps for the user
Proposes follow-up queries to explore the topic further
This proactive behavior is characteristic of an intelligent agent that anticipates and assists with user needs.


Continuous Learning:
By storing the results and GPT analyses of new searches, the system is continually expanding its knowledge base. This allows it to "learn" from each interaction, potentially improving its performance over time.
Goal-Oriented Behavior:
The system's actions are driven by the goal of providing the most relevant and useful information to the user. This is evident in how it analyzes search results and provides structured, actionable output.
Multi-Source Integration:
By combining results from Google, DuckDuckGo, and potentially YouTube, the system demonstrates the ability to integrate information from multiple sources - a key feature of many intelligent agents.
Natural Language Processing:
The use of GPT for analyzing search results shows the system's capability to understand and generate natural language, allowing for more sophisticated interactions.
Context Awareness:
The similarity search function allows the system to maintain a form of context awareness across different searches, recognizing when new queries are related to previous ones.
Intelligent Filtering and Prioritization:
The system doesn't just pass along raw search results. It intelligently filters and prioritizes information, presenting what it determines to be most relevant to the user's query.
Initiative in Interaction:
By suggesting follow-up queries and next steps, the system takes initiative in guiding the user's information-seeking process, rather than being purely reactive.
